# ChatBot-using-Python-and-Deep-Learning
In this Python project a chatbot is made using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on
the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I used a special recurrent
neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then i will give
a random response from the list of responses.
